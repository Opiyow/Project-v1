# Project Phase 1
# Project Overview
This project aims to use exploratory data analysis to generate insights for a business stakeholder aiming to venture into a new line of business
# Business Understanding
Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational technology corporation which produces computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services. They are looking to diversify and venture into the movie scene by opening up a movie studio. Before making the big leap, they need to have a better understanding of the movie industry. To this end, I have been tasked with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office and then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what genre of films to produce.
# Problem Statement
The movie industry is without a doubt just as competitive and as dependent on internal and external factors as any other industry. A knowledge management system on the industry is therefore essential in order to navigate the industry successfully. The main challenge is the uncontrollability of the product, there is now way to predict how the audience will interact with it. This large financial gamble therefore necessitates an in-depth analysis on which genres of movies are preferred by majority of the audience and those that generate high returns on investments.
